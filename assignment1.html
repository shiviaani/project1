      Loss of habitat
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 65 million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached. The dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became endangered, then extinct. Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different ways.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Ivory billed woodpecker</h3>
      <p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) is an extremely rare member of the woodpecker family, Picidae. It is officially listed as an endangered species, but by the end of the 20th century had widely been considered extinct until it was apparently sighted along the Cache River in Arkansas in 2004 and 2005.Despite published reports from Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana, and sporadic reports elsewhere in the historic range of the species since the 1940s, no universally accepted evidence exists for the continued existence of the ivory-billed woodpecker; i.e., no undisputed photographs, videos, specimens or DNA samples from feathers or feces of the ivory-billed woodpecker are available. Land acquisition and habitat restoration efforts have been initiated in certain areas where a relatively high probability exists that the species might survive to protect any possible surviving individuals.Campephilus is a genus of woodpecker sometimes called the ivory-billed woodpecker, although the term is more commonly used to describe the American and Cuban ivory-billed woodpeckers.
      Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii or Campephilus bairdii), is now believed to be extinct.
      American ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis principalis or Campephilus principalis), is described here.
      The ivory-billed woodpecker is the type species for the genus Campephilus, a group of large American woodpeckers. Although they look very similar to the pileated woodpeckers, they are not close relatives as the pileated is a member of the genus Dryocopus.

      Ornithologists have traditionally recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker. The two look similar despite differences in size and plumage. Some controversy exists over whether the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker is more appropriately recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed birds along with the imperial woodpecker, a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded not only that the Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene. The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">African wild dog</h3>
      <p>The African Wild Dog can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, with the largest concentration in Tanzania and Northern Mozambique. The wild dogs live in packs, which can vary from 10 to 40 dogs. A monogamous mated pair usually dominates each pack. African wild dogs are also very social, helping the sick and weak, sharing food, and "talking" to each other through vocalizations and touch.Human interaction, loss of habitat, and the spreading of diseases like rabies are the main threats to African wild dogs. Many farmers shoot and poison African wild dogs because they blame the species for loss of livestock. Human settlements and farms are expanding , which takes away from the land where the African wild dogs roam.</p>

      <p>The Hawksbill turtle get its name of its narrow beak. They use it to extract sea sponges from crevices, their main source of food. They also eat sea anemones and jellyfish.
      However, their beautiful shells are one of the reasons they are so endangered. Their shells are sold as part of the tourist trade. Loss of nesting, over harvesting of their eggs, pollution, poaching, and bycatch.</p>
